    #To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:
        #1. If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
        #2. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
        #3. If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
        #4. The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
        #5. The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).
