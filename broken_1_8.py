#Grab a year, check if it's a leap year, if not find the next closest ones

#   on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
#   except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
#   unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

#Challenge:  If not a leap year, be creative and find a leap year...loop, function, random, find the next one?
